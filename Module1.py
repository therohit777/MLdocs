# Notes:
# Machine Learning:
# A field in. Computer Science that uses statistical techniques to give computer the ability to learn with data without being explicitly programmed.

# Explicit Programming:
#    1. Data + Program -> output
# Machine Learning:
#    1. Data + output -> Program





# History:
# Started with symbolic AI:
# Symbolic AI: If-Else based big knowledge system.
# Expert System: with help of Expert people of a field Symbolic based knowledge systems were built.

# Symbolic AI: Failed in Fuzzy logic. For Ex: Dog breed recognition through Image. So, ML came into play.

# Bigger domain wise: Al>ML>DL
# Bigger power wise: DL > ML

# DL: Same as ML but, more powerful and its algorithm are inspired by biology of our neurons

# Difference ML Vs DL
# 1. Features:
#        In ML have to provided, in DL 
#        automatically extracted.
#   2. Efficiency: 
#       In ML gets saturated after a 
#       point, In DL by addding more   
#       layers of neurons can be 
#       increase.
#  3. Datasets:
#       ML works better in smaller 
#       datasets, DL works better in 
#       larger datasets







# Types: machine Learning
#   1. Supervised
#   2. ⁠Unsupervised 
#   3. ⁠Semi-Supervised 
#   4. ⁠Reinforcement 

# 1. Supervised:
#        Both Input and output 
#        datasets available 
       
#        Types:
#        A. Regression 
#        B. Classification 
       
#        Regression: numerical data as 
#        output(numerical value as 
#        output)
      
#       Classification: categorical data 
#       as output.(Strjngs, characters 
#       as data)


#    2. Unsupervised: 
#        Only input are present as 
#        datasets.
        
#        Types:
#         A. Clustering:
#         B. Dimensionality Reduction:
#         C. Anomaly Detection:
#         D. Association Rule:

#       A. Clustering: Grouping of 
#           similar datasets
     
#       B. Dimensionality Reduction: 
#           Reducing the no. Of columns 
#           in datasets by combing 
#           similar related columns

#      C. Anomaly Detection: 
#          Removing of unknown data      
#          from datasets which wasn’t 
#          present while training 
#          through datasets.

#      D. Association Rule: fetching 
#          insights from associated 
#          data(data mining) and 
#          drawing conclusions

#    3. Semi - Supervised:
#         We label or provide output of      
#         few datasets manually the    
#         rest data gets labelled by 
#         machine learning algorithms 
#         itself.
  
#   4. Reinforcement Learning:
#       Has no datasets: It has agents 
#       which performs action in 
#       environment, gets some 
#       feedback and basically on that 
#       it generates own datasets and 
#       acts positively next time
