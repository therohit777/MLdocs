# Challenges in Machine Learning:
# 1. Data 
# 2. ⁠Insufficient data
# 3. ⁠Non-Representative data
# 4. ⁠Irrelevant features
# 5. ⁠Poor data Quality 

# Overfitting :
# Memorizing the old datasets by a model, model provide 100% accuracy in the old datasets and provide bad results in the new data. This is called overfitting 

# Underfitting :
# Here model doesn’t learn much just makes its own opinion and acts accordingly, which proves to be bad for old as well as new datasets. This is called underfitting.


# Application of Machine Learning:
# 1. Stock increase of products in 
#        ecommmerce platforms.

#   2. Banking and Finance: 
#        comparing your profile with 
#        past defaulters list to sanction 
#        loans.

#   3. Ola cab Service: Region where 
#        more demand less supply 
#        charges are more.

#   4. Manufacturing: predicting 
#        maintenance of robotic arms 
#        like in Teslas.

#   5. Social Media: Understand 
#        people sentiments through 
#        their posts or their hobbies. 
#        And sell their data to 
#        companies of that relevant 
#        domains of that interest




# Machine Learning Development LifeCycle (MLDLC):
# 1. Framing the problem
#        (Cost,tools to be used, 
#        problem understanding).

# 2. ⁠Gathering Data:
#        i. Csv files
#        ii. APIs
#        iii. Web scraping 

#   3. Data Preprocessing. (To clean 
#       the data)
   
#    4. EDA (Exploratory Data 
#        Analysis):
#        Analysis the relationships 
#        between input and output in 
#        datasets by finding out hidden 
#        patterns/ insights lying within 
#        the data. (Graph plots, column 
#        analyzation, etc)
  
#    5. Feature Engineering and 
#        Selection:
#        Creating new feature/columns 
#         if needed. And selecting 
#         relevant features/column in 
#         order to draw insights from 
#         data.

#   6. Model Training, Evaluation and 
#       Selection:
#       Test out all algorithms and find 
#       out the best performing 
#       algorithms .

#   7. Model Deployment 
  
#   8. Testing
  
#    9. Optimize
#        (Retraining, monitoring, data 
#        backup, load balancing, etc)

# Ensemble Learning:
# Combining multiple the best performing algorithms in order to build a more powerful algorithm.


# Some Job Profiles:
# 1. Data Engineer: 1. Move data from  Database to Datawarehouse. 
#                   2. Helps in Data Gathering.

# 2. Data Analyst:  1. Cleaning the data.
#                   2. It give insights of data related to past.
#                   3. Data Preprocessing or little EDA.

# 3. Data Scientist: 1. A Data Scientist is someone who is better at statistics 
#                       than any software Engineer and better at software Engineering 
#                       than any stastician.

#                    2. Full work flow of MLDLC.
#                    3. It give predictions from data about the future use.
